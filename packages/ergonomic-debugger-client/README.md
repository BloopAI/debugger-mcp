# Ergonomic Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) Client

This project is a Node.js library, written in idiomatic TypeScript, designed to provide a high-level, ergonomic, and robust interface for interacting with DAP-compliant debug adapters.

It aims to simplify the development of custom debugger interfaces and tools by abstracting the complexities of DAP message handling, state management, and asynchronous communication, with a strong focus on creating a maintainable and clear codebase.

This initial release provides the foundational structure and a tested, functional basic subset of debugger APIs.
